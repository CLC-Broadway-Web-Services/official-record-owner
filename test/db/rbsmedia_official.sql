At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion. In 1849,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Plateau\">Joseph Plateau</a>&nbsp;published about the idea to combine his invention of the ph&eacute;nakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone\">Charles Wheatstone</a>, and use photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the &quot;St&eacute;r&eacute;oscope-fantascope, ou B&iuml;oscope&quot;. He marginally advertised it for a short period. It was a commercial failure and no complete instrument has yet been located, but one bioscope disc has been preserved in the Plateau collection of the Ghent University. It has stereoscopic photographs of a machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late 1850s the first examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_photography\">instantaneous photography</a>&nbsp;came about and provided hope that motion photography would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge\">Eadweard Muybridge</a>&nbsp;eventually managed to take a series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion\">The Horse in Motion</a></em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_card\">cabinet cards</a>.

Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope\">zoopraxiscope</a>&nbsp;in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Ansch&uuml;tz developed his own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotachyscope\">Electrotachyscope</a>&nbsp;in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud\">&Eacute;mile Reynaud</a>&nbsp;already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_de_photographie\">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise de photographie</a>&nbsp;on 4 June 1880, but did not market his&nbsp;<em>praxinoscope a projection</em>&nbsp;before 1882. He then further developed the device into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_Optique\">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Optique</a>&nbsp;which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus&eacute;e Gr&eacute;vin in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\"><img alt=\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s Le Voyage dans la Lune, showing a projectile in the man in the moon\'s eye from 1902\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg/220px-Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A famous shot from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\">Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Voyage_dans_la_Lune\">Le Voyage dans la Lune</a>&nbsp;(A Trip to the Moon)</em>&nbsp;(1902), an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_film\">narrative film</a>&nbsp;and also an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\">science fiction film</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First motion pictures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid\">celluloid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film\">photographic film</a>&nbsp;and the invention of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera\">motion picture cameras</a>, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel\">reel</a>&nbsp;of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893. The following year the company would begin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Studios\">Edison Studios</a>, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(1896_film)\">The Kiss</a></em>, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodville_Latham\">Woodville Latham</a>&nbsp;and his sons, using films produced by their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidoloscope\">Eidoloscope</a>&nbsp;company,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film#cite_note-2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;and by the &ndash; arguably better known &ndash; French brothers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re\">Auguste and Louis Lumi&egrave;re</a>&nbsp;with ten of their own productions.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham&#39;s slightly predating the Lumi&egrave;re brothers&#39;.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Early evolution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest films were simply one static&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(filming)\">shot</a>&nbsp;that showed an event or action with no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing\">editing</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematic_technique\">cinematic techniques</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano\">pianist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)\">organist</a>&nbsp;or, in large urban theaters, a full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra\">orchestra</a>&nbsp;to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score\">film scores</a>&nbsp;were composed for major productions.</p>', '1617251779-blog_3.jpg', '1617261402-blog_detail.jpg', '', '', '', 1, '2021-03-24 09:05:50', NULL),

But what stands in the way is the obstacle to garner an audience for your film; which sadly doesn&rsquo;t become an easy task no matter how incredible your work is. The various video sharing platforms although offer you to upload your film on their services, there is a very shallow chance that it&rsquo;ll reach a viewer count enough to provide you any benefits.

From work of popular production houses to small budget independent films, everything shows up on festivals that take place around the globe.

Attended by many significant and important people of cinema, it provides various different opportunities for new and upcoming films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Does It Benefit You and Your Film?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Networking and Funding Opportunities</strong><br />\r\nAs aforementioned, a film festival hosts many people from the industry. Thus your film has an opportunity to be noticed by big producers and executives who could meet up with you to offer funding for your next project or some valuable advice based on your work. Also with many other filmmakers present, you have the chance to connect and collaborate with the people whose work you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exposure </strong><br />\r\nA certain factor that benefits you film in a festival is an audience of film enthusiasts, providing their undivided attention to the screening of your film. That not only helps in valuable critique of your work, but your story could also compel people in the audience to work with you in your future projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Awards and Prizes </strong><br />\r\nTo be recognized as an award-winning filmmaker is a great title on its own, but many film festivals offer various prizes along with the credibility to your name. You could stand to win distribution of your film, filmmaking gear, cash prizes etc. if you are deemed victorious at a festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Film Festival Circuit and Attracting Niche Audiences </strong><br />\r\nThe many local festival organizers are connected and observant of each other&rsquo;s film events; which helps your submission as you get a probable chance of being invited to screen your film at other festivals. Also getting your submission selected for screening increases your chance to be accepted by the festivals again.<br />\r\nMany film festivals also host events for specific categories of films which are mostly attended by niche audiences. If your project falls under the dedicated category, the chances of your selection and winning become higher and you could attract a particular audience for your style of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But keeping the various benefits in mind, there are some factors you should consider before submitting your film in a festival to make the best out of it. Choosing the right festival, what festivals to attend, how to know your film is ready for submission, how to make the perfect pitch for your project etc. are important elements, which if rightfully done, could marvelously help your film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for that, reaching out to a film agency who participates in these events and services helps as they can provide you with a well constructed festival strategy and ensure a much better performance of your project at the event.</p>', '1626353368-film festival blog.png', '1626353368-film festival blog 2.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, '2021-07-15 12:49:28', NULL);

Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893.

Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano\">pianist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)\">organist</a>&nbsp;or, in large urban theaters, a full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra\">orchestra</a>&nbsp;to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score\">film scores</a>&nbsp;were composed for major productions.</p>', '1617188693-services_4.jpg', '', '', '', 1, '2021-03-24 09:05:50', NULL),

The following year the company would begin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Studios\">Edison Studios</a>, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(1896_film)\">The Kiss</a></em>, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodville_Latham\">Woodville Latham</a>&nbsp;and his sons, using films produced by their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidoloscope\">Eidoloscope</a>&nbsp;company,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film#cite_note-2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;and by the &ndash; arguably better known &ndash; French brothers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re\">Auguste and Louis Lumi&egrave;re</a>&nbsp;with ten of their own productions.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham&#39;s slightly predating the Lumi&egrave;re brothers&#39;.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Early evolution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest films were simply one static&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(filming)\">shot</a>&nbsp;that showed an event or action with no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing\">editing</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematic_technique\">cinematic techniques</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano\">pianist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)\">organist</a>&nbsp;or, in large urban theaters, a full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra\">orchestra</a>&nbsp;to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score\">film scores</a>&nbsp;were composed for major productions.</p>', '1617188693-services_4.jpg', '', '', '', 1, '2021-03-24 09:05:50', NULL);

At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion. In 1849,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Plateau\">Joseph Plateau</a>&nbsp;published about the idea to combine his invention of the ph&eacute;nakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone\">Charles Wheatstone</a>, and use photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the &quot;St&eacute;r&eacute;oscope-fantascope, ou B&iuml;oscope&quot;. He marginally advertised it for a short period. It was a commercial failure and no complete instrument has yet been located, but one bioscope disc has been preserved in the Plateau collection of the Ghent University. It has stereoscopic photographs of a machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late 1850s the first examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_photography\">instantaneous photography</a>&nbsp;came about and provided hope that motion photography would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge\">Eadweard Muybridge</a>&nbsp;eventually managed to take a series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion\">The Horse in Motion</a></em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_card\">cabinet cards</a>.

Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope\">zoopraxiscope</a>&nbsp;in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Ansch&uuml;tz developed his own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotachyscope\">Electrotachyscope</a>&nbsp;in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud\">&Eacute;mile Reynaud</a>&nbsp;already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_de_photographie\">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise de photographie</a>&nbsp;on 4 June 1880, but did not market his&nbsp;<em>praxinoscope a projection</em>&nbsp;before 1882. He then further developed the device into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_Optique\">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Optique</a>&nbsp;which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus&eacute;e Gr&eacute;vin in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\"><img alt=\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s Le Voyage dans la Lune, showing a projectile in the man in the moon\'s eye from 1902\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg/220px-Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A famous shot from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\">Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Voyage_dans_la_Lune\">Le Voyage dans la Lune</a>&nbsp;(A Trip to the Moon)</em>&nbsp;(1902), an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_film\">narrative film</a>&nbsp;and also an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\">science fiction film</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First motion pictures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid\">celluloid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film\">photographic film</a>&nbsp;and the invention of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera\">motion picture cameras</a>, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel\">reel</a>&nbsp;of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893.

Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination.

At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion.

In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the &quot;St&eacute;r&eacute;oscope-fantascope, ou B&iuml;oscope&quot;. He marginally advertised it for a short period.

Ansch&uuml;tz developed his own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotachyscope\">Electrotachyscope</a>&nbsp;in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud\">&Eacute;mile Reynaud</a>&nbsp;already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope.

He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus&eacute;e Gr&eacute;vin in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\"><img alt=\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s Le Voyage dans la Lune, showing a projectile in the man in the moon\'s eye from 1902\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg/220px-Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A famous shot from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\">Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Voyage_dans_la_Lune\">Le Voyage dans la Lune</a>&nbsp;(A Trip to the Moon)</em>&nbsp;(1902), an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_film\">narrative film</a>&nbsp;and also an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\">science fiction film</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First motion pictures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid\">celluloid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film\">photographic film</a>&nbsp;and the invention of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera\">motion picture cameras</a>, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel\">reel</a>&nbsp;of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893.

Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story.

Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope\">zoopraxiscope</a>&nbsp;in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Ansch&uuml;tz developed his own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotachyscope\">Electrotachyscope</a>&nbsp;in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud\">&Eacute;mile Reynaud</a>&nbsp;already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_de_photographie\">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise de photographie</a>&nbsp;on 4 June 1880, but did not market his&nbsp;<em>praxinoscope a projection</em>&nbsp;before 1882. He then further developed the device into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_Optique\">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Optique</a>&nbsp;which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus&eacute;e Gr&eacute;vin in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\"><img alt=\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s Le Voyage dans la Lune, showing a projectile in the man in the moon\'s eye from 1902\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg/220px-Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A famous shot from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\">Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Voyage_dans_la_Lune\">Le Voyage dans la Lune</a>&nbsp;(A Trip to the Moon)</em>&nbsp;(1902), an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_film\">narrative film</a>&nbsp;and also an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\">science fiction film</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First motion pictures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid\">celluloid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film\">photographic film</a>&nbsp;and the invention of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera\">motion picture cameras</a>, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel\">reel</a>&nbsp;of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893. The following year the company would begin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Studios\">Edison Studios</a>, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(1896_film)\">The Kiss</a></em>, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodville_Latham\">Woodville Latham</a>&nbsp;and his sons, using films produced by their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidoloscope\">Eidoloscope</a>&nbsp;company,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film#cite_note-2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;and by the &ndash; arguably better known &ndash; French brothers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re\">Auguste and Louis Lumi&egrave;re</a>&nbsp;with ten of their own productions.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham&#39;s slightly predating the Lumi&egrave;re brothers&#39;.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Early evolution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest films were simply one static&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(filming)\">shot</a>&nbsp;that showed an event or action with no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing\">editing</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematic_technique\">cinematic techniques</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano\">pianist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)\">organist</a>&nbsp;or, in large urban theaters, a full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra\">orchestra</a>&nbsp;to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score\">film scores</a>&nbsp;were composed for major productions.</p>', '1617188693-services_4.jpg', '', '', '', 1, '2021-03-24 09:05:50', NULL);

At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion. In 1849,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Plateau\">Joseph Plateau</a>&nbsp;published about the idea to combine his invention of the ph&eacute;nakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone\">Charles Wheatstone</a>, and use photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the &quot;St&eacute;r&eacute;oscope-fantascope, ou B&iuml;oscope&quot;. He marginally advertised it for a short period. It was a commercial failure and no complete instrument has yet been located, but one bioscope disc has been preserved in the Plateau collection of the Ghent University. It has stereoscopic photographs of a machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late 1850s the first examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_photography\">instantaneous photography</a>&nbsp;came about and provided hope that motion photography would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge\">Eadweard Muybridge</a>&nbsp;eventually managed to take a series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion\">The Horse in Motion</a></em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_card\">cabinet cards</a>. Muybridge, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey\">&Eacute;tienne-Jules Marey</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottomar_Ansch%C3%BCtz\">Ottomar Ansch&uuml;tz</a>&nbsp;and many others would create many more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronophotography\">chronophotography</a>&nbsp;studies. Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope\">zoopraxiscope</a>&nbsp;in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Ansch&uuml;tz developed his own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotachyscope\">Electrotachyscope</a>&nbsp;in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud\">&Eacute;mile Reynaud</a>&nbsp;already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_de_photographie\">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise de photographie</a>&nbsp;on 4 June 1880, but did not market his&nbsp;<em>praxinoscope a projection</em>&nbsp;before 1882. He then further developed the device into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_Optique\">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Optique</a>&nbsp;which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus&eacute;e Gr&eacute;vin in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\"><img alt=\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s Le Voyage dans la Lune, showing a projectile in the man in the moon\'s eye from 1902\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg/220px-Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg\" style=\"height:226px; width:220px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A famous shot from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\">Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Voyage_dans_la_Lune\">Le Voyage dans la Lune</a>&nbsp;(A Trip to the Moon)</em>&nbsp;(1902), an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_film\">narrative film</a>&nbsp;and also an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\">science fiction film</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First motion pictures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid\">celluloid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film\">photographic film</a>&nbsp;and the invention of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_camera\">motion picture cameras</a>, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel\">reel</a>&nbsp;of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a &quot;peep show&quot; device such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope\">mutoscope</a>. Others were intended for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector\">projector</a>, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these &quot;moving pictures&quot; could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_Scene\">Blacksmith Scene</a>, produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Manufacturing_Company\">Edison Manufacturing Company</a>&nbsp;in 1893. The following year the company would begin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Studios\">Edison Studios</a>, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(1896_film)\">The Kiss</a></em>, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodville_Latham\">Woodville Latham</a>&nbsp;and his sons, using films produced by their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidoloscope\">Eidoloscope</a>&nbsp;company,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film#cite_note-2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;and by the &ndash; arguably better known &ndash; French brothers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re\">Auguste and Louis Lumi&egrave;re</a>&nbsp;with ten of their own productions.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham&#39;s slightly predating the Lumi&egrave;re brothers&#39;.[<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed</a></em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Early evolution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest films were simply one static&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(filming)\">shot</a>&nbsp;that showed an event or action with no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing\">editing</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematic_technique\">cinematic techniques</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(filming)\">scenes</a>&nbsp;together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film\">sound film</a>&nbsp;became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts\">visual art</a>, but these innovative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film\">silent films</a>&nbsp;had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano\">pianist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)\">organist</a>&nbsp;or, in large urban theaters, a full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra\">orchestra</a>&nbsp;to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score\">film scores</a>&nbsp;were composed for major productions.</p>', '1617188693-services_4.jpg', '', '', '', 1, '2021-03-24 09:05:50', NULL);
